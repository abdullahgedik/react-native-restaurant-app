# Restaurant Reservation Mobile App

To set up the project after cloning, install dependencies from the `RestaurantReservationApp` directory:

```bash
cd RestaurantReservationApp
npm install
```

After installing, you can start the Expo development server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Backend API

This repository also includes a small Express based API used for restaurant and reservation data. From the repository root install its dependencies and start the server:

```bash
npm install
npm start # runs server.js on port 3001
```

Run the mobile app and API in separate terminals so both processes stay
active while you use the application.
